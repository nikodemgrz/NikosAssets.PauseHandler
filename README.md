## About

Provides ingame pause states and events you can subscribe to, as well as a few optional helper scripts that freeze the time during a pause and handle player inputs to toggle the pause state. 
Note that this package uses the new inputsystem from unity as a dependency.

Checkout the [Features](#features) section below for more information about the specific use cases and available helper scripts.

## Setup

### Unity Package Dependency

To add this toolkit as a package dependency to your Unity project, locate your manifest file in "Package/manifest.json" or add the git-url via the package manager UI.

In the previous versions of this package you had to add the NaughtyAttributes package dependency to the "scopedRegistries". Unfortunately this forced you to use a specific fork or version, so to avoid that restriction you have to add the NaughtyAttributes git url (fork/ version) of your liking yourself.

The current dependency is a fork with performance improvements ([https://github.com/niggo1243/NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/niggo1243/NaughtyAttributes)) of the original open-source project NaughtyAttributes by dbrizov: [https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes)

The original NaughtyAttributes package works as well though and if you already have it installed, you don't have to add the forked branch in the following steps!

Add the following lines to the "dependencies" section to include this package and my helpers package dependency (scopedRegistries automatic dependency resolve setup is in progress!):
```
"com.nikosassets.helpers": "https://github.com/niggo1243/Unity3DHelperTools.git#upm"
"com.nikosassets.pausehandler": "https://github.com/niggo1243/NikosAssets.PauseHandler.git"
```

For my NaughtyAttributes performance improvements fork:
```
"com.nikosassets.naughtyattributes": "https://github.com/niggo1243/NaughtyAttributes.git#upm"
```

The original branch:
```
"com.dbrizov.naughtyattributes": "https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes.git#upm"
```

You can also choose specific releases and tags after the "#" instead of "upm".

## Features

In depth sample scenes & feature showcase with pictures/ gifs [TBA].

In short:

- Add the ```BasePauseManager``` component and optionally (for global access) the ```PauseManagerProvider``` component to your scene, referencing your ```BasePauseManager```.
- You can pause or unpause the game by calling the ```Pause()```, ```UnPause()``` or ```TogglePause()``` functions located in the ```BasePauseManager``` class.
- If you want to toggle the pause by player input ("Esc" for PC and "Options" for gamepads) add the ```TogglPauseByInput``` component in the same scene and reference the ```BasePauseManager``` component, as well as the input actions (available in the settings folder).
- If you want to change the timescale (for example freeze the time during pause), add the ```ChangeTimeScalePauseListener``` component in the same scene and reference the ```BasePauseManager``` component.
